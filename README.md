# Minecraft Dedicated Server Discord Bot - Better name coming soon

## What does it do?

This is a utility to manage a dedicated Minecraft server and to integrate with discord.

## Why Discord integration?

Plenty of discord communities, even communities not centered around Minecraft, often host their own Minecraft servers as a way to increase community involvement.
Since Discord is already a hub for several of these communities, this tool will make managing a free server easier while increasing involvement.

## What does Discord integration look like?

##### Here are the currently integrated features:

- Server Status (Online, Offline)
- Number of players online
- Viewing server settings
- Changing gamemode settings
- Running server commands

##### Here are planned future integrated features:

- Ability to opt in for notifications:
  - The bot will not ping you if you are already playing on the server
  - Be notified anytime anyone joins or when a certain number of people are playing - you decide!
- Restricing access to commands based on roles
- Update the dedicated server version entirely through Discord
- Allow certain users to upload a world file

## Requirements

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/applications) Bot keys
